When hacking up BASH scripts, I often find there are some
higherlevel things like logging, configuration, commandline argument
parsing that:

 - I need everytime
 - Take quite some effort to get right
 - Keep you from your actual work

Here's an attempt to bundle those things in a generalized way so that
they are reusable as-is in most of my (and hopefully your, if not ping
me) programs.

An up to date [intro is found on the original blog](http://kvz.io/blog/2013/02/26/introducing-bash3boilerplate/).

## Installation

There are 3 ways you can install (parts of) b3bp:
 1. Get the main boilerplate and template: `mkdir ~/bin/ && wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arathai/bash3boilerplate/master/bsbp -O ~/bin/bsbp && wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arathai/bash3boilerplate/master/template`
 2. Clone the entire project: `git clone https://github.com/arathai/bash3boilerplate/`
 3. As of `v1.0.3`, b3bp can be installed as a `package.json` dependency via: `npm install --save bash3boilerplate`

Although `3` introduces a node.js dependency, this does allow for easy version pinning & distrubtions in environments that already have this prerequisite. But nothing prevents you from just using `curl` and keep your project or build system low on external dependencies.

## Versioning

This project implements the Semantic Versioning guidelines.

Releases will be numbered with the following format:

`<major>.<minor>.<patch>`

And constructed with the following guidelines:

* Breaking backward compatibility bumps the major (and resets the minor and patch)
* New additions without breaking backward compatibility bumps the minor (and resets the patch)
* Bug fixes and misc changes bumps the patch


For more information on SemVer, please visit [http://semver.org](http://semver.org).

## Best practices

As of `v1.0.3`, b3bp adds some nice re-usable libraries in `./src`. Later on we'll be using snippets inside this directory to build custom packages. In order to make the snippets in `./src` more useful, we recommend these guidelines.

### Library exports

It's nice to have a bash package that can be used in the terminal and also be invoked as a command line function. To achieve this the exporting of your functionality *should* follow this pattern:

```bash
if [ "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}" != ${0} ]; then
  export -f my_script
else
  my_script "${@}"
  exit $?
fi
```

This allows a user to `source` your script or invoke as a script.

```bash
# Running as a script
$ ./my_script.sh some args --blah
# Sourcing the script
$ source my_script.sh
$ my_script some more args --blah
```

(taken from the [bpkg](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bpkg/bpkg/master/README.md) project)

## Todo

 - [ ] Make `src` libs adhere to Best practices
 - [ ] `make build` system for generating custom builds
 - [ ] tests & releases via Travis
